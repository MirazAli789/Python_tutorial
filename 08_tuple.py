# tuples are same as lists but they are immutable
# for exmple:
# tpl = (1,2,3,4)
# print(tpl)
# # tpl[1]=2 # this is invalid
# print(tpl.index(3))
# print(len(tpl))
# tpl2 = (2,67,4,214,65)
# print(tpl2[3])
tp = (31, 2, 3, 2, 545, 12)
print(tp.count(2))
print(tp.index(31))
print(len(tp))
# tp[0] = 12  # throw an error
print(tp)
